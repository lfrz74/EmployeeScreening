# Original Objectives
The original objectives of the project:

Create a GET endpoint with the signature: /api/localweather/{id}
The id is a v4 GUID that is to be looked up from the database's users table.
It will return two columns, latitude and longitude, that should then be used to return the results of an external weather api endpoint.
The endpoint, https://api.weather.gov/points/{lat},{lon}, is detailed here: https://weather-gov.github.io/api/general-faqs
Note The provided database should not be changed in any way. Our DBA wouldn't like that!
A known id: 80aa3684-1512-4e03-88c4-072670cc9459
